.Sh NAME
.Nm rept
.Nd repeat a command
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar program
.Op Ar argument ...
.Nm
.Op options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility calls the given command,
waits for it to finish, then calls it again and so on
until it is killed or standard output becomes unavailable.
The return value of the command is ignored.
.Pp
The Windows version of
.Nm
does no argument escaping of any kind;
the command line following 
.Nm
is passed to the system verbatim.
This means that the command is not executed within a
.Em cmd.exe
context. 
To use
.Em cmd
built-ins, invoke
.Em cmd
as part of the command line as in the example below.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Print a short help message and exit.
.It Fl v
Print version and exit.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The equivalent to the
.Em yes
command is:
.Pp
.Dl rept echo yes
.Pp
On Windows, we need to go though
.Em cmd
because
.Em echo
is a built-in:
.Pp
.Dl rept cmd /c echo yes
.Pp
.Sh EXIT STATUS
When standard output becomes unavailable the program terminates
with exit status 0.
Should an error or abnormal termination occur, the exit status is nonzero.
